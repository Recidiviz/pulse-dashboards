## What is Work Release? How does it work?

Work Release (formally known as the Community Transition Program) is a program that allows MDOC residents to leave the facility during the day to work at an approved job in the community. The program helps you save up money and gain job experience to prepare you for life after release.

### Employment & Wages

You'll be paid the typical wage for your job in the community.

### Deductions

A portion of your wages will automatically be deducted for the following items:

<dl>
<dt>Room and board</dt>
<dd>
If you pay for transportation, 10% of your earnings (before taxes) are deducted for room and board. This is the most common scenario.

If you don’t pay for transportation, 20% of your earnings (before taxes) are deducted for room and board.

</dd>
<dt>Fines and restitution</dt>
<dd>If you owe court fines and restitution, 25% of your earnings (before taxes) go towards paying those.</dd>
<dt>Transportation</dt>
<dd>$50 will be deducted per week for transportation (if applicable). This is a flat fee, which means it does not change based on how many days you go in to work.</dd>
<dt>Savings</dt>
<dd>
At least 10% of your earnings (before taxes) will be put into your account as savings, until you’ve saved $1,000.

Once you’ve saved $1,000, you can decide whether or not you want to have savings automatically deducted from your earnings.

You can choose to have more than 10% deducted from your earnings if you want.</dd>

<dt>Child support</dt>
<dd>
If you owe child support, the amount you owe is dependent on your agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services.

You can discuss options with DHHS depending on your ability to pay.

<dt>Other costs</dt>
<dd>You will also have to purchase a lunchbox, which will be yours to keep after release.</dd>

### Transportation

- You will have to travel to and from the facility to your job site, typically on a bus or van with other residents.
- You will likely have to cover the cost of transportation to and from your job site.

### Residence

You’d continue to live in an MDOC facility.

### Program Rules

- You must follow the rules of the Work Release program while participating, such as:
  - You have to sign in and out of the facility when you go to your job.
  - You cannot have electronic devices outside of your job duties.
  - You can’t contact anyone via mail, email, telephone calls, texts, etc. outside of your work duties.
  - You cannot leave the facility with any unallowable or contraband property, nor can you return from your work site with any property you did not take with you.
  - You cannot have or use drugs and alcohol. You may have to take drug tests.
  - You must report any contact with law enforcement to facility staff.

### Supervision

- While on the job, you’ll be supervised by your employer.
- Facility staff will randomly check in on you at your workplace on a weekly basis.

## What if I’m not interested in Work Release?

### Facility Jobs

- You can still work on the facility grounds, instead of out in the community.
- Most facility jobs pay less than those in the community. However, if you work at a job on facility grounds, costs like room and board or transportation will not be deducted from your earnings.

### Supervised Community Confinement Program (SCCP)

- SCCP is a program for MDOC residents who are almost done with their prison sentence. It is sometimes called “home confinement.”
- If eligible, you can apply to spend the last portion of your sentence in the community, while under the supervision of a probation officer.

### Furlough Passes

- Furlough passes give you special permission to leave the facility for a short period of time to visit your family or for other important reasons.
- To be approved for a furlough, you must have a thorough, detailed plan that involves visiting close family and going to stable, substance-free places. Furloughs can be difficult to get approved.
