## What is my Current Release Date?

Your Current Release Date is the date you would be released if you do not earn or lose any additional good time after today. It factors in the good time you’ve earned so far and any county jail credit you received for time you served prior to enter a DOC facility. Since it does not factor in any good time you earn in the future, if you continue earning good time, your Current Release Date will move earlier.

## What about my Earliest Custody Release Date?

You may have heard about your “Earliest Custody Release Date.” This date is shown on the Maine DOC website that people on the outside can use to look up your case and sentence details. However, you shouldn’t rely on this date as an accurate representation when you might be released.

This date is calculated assuming that you will earn the maximum amount of good time every month based on the good time policy that applies to your sentence. The calculation may assume that you are earning more good time than you currently can earn based on your custody level or program participation.
