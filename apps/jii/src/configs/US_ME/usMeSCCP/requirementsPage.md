## How do I qualify for SCCP?

To apply for SCCP, you must first work with your case manager to make sure that you meet all of the following eligibility requirements:

### Time served

- If you were sentenced to five years or fewer, you must serve 1/2 of your sentence.
- If you were sentenced to more than five years or have a split sentence, you must serve 2/3 of your sentence.
- You must have fewer than 30 months remaining on your sentence.
- You must have spent more than 120 days incarcerated in a MDOC facility.

### Custody level

- You must be classified as minimum or community custody.

### Charges and violations

- You must have no detainers, warrants, or pending holds.
- You must have no Class A or B disciplines within the last 90 days.

### Programming and case plan

- You must be participating in assigned core programs.
- You must be following your case plan in the facility.

### Housing

- You must have suitable housing set up for after release. On SCCP, you must live in Maine.
- Housing options could include: a house, apartment, sober living residence, transitional housing, education or vocational training housing, or treatment or healthcare facility.

### Employment and finances

- While on SCCP, you must have a job or be in school. If not, you should be searching for one.
- If you qualify for Social Security or disability benefits, you may be able to use those instead.

### Treatment

- Depending on your case, you may have to participate in treatment while you’re on SCCP.
- Ask your case manager about any treatment requirements you may have.
- In certain cases, you may not have to go to work or school if you’re in treatment.

## How is my Current Release Date calculated?

Your Current Release Date is calculated by taking the amount of time you were sentenced to DOC custody, minus the amount of good time you earned and any jail time credit you’ve been given.

It does not factor in any good time you will earn after today, so if you continue earning good time, your Current Release Date will move earlier.

For example, let’s say you were sentenced to 10 years, and you spent 1 year in jail prior to entering a DOC facility, and have earned 1 year of good time so far. If you entered the DOC facility on 1/1/2020, your Current Release Date would be 1/1/2028 (10 years minus 2 years of credit and good time).

## What is a 1/2 Time or 2/3 Time Date? How are those calculated?

Your 1/2 or 2/3 Time Date falls halfway or two-thirds of the way between the date you first entered a DOC facility and your Current Release Date.

For example, if you entered a DOC facility on 1/1/2020, and your Current Release Date is 1/1/2028, your 1/2 time date would be on 1/1/2024. If your Current Release Date moves earlier because you earn good time, your 1/2 or 2/3 Time Date will also move earlier.

If your sentence is between 0 to 5 years, you must pass your 1/2 Time Date to be eligible for SCCP. If your sentence is longer than 5 years, you must pass your 2/3 Time Date to be eligible for SCCP.
