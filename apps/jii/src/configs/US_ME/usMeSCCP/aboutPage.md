## What is SCCP? How does it work?

SCCP is a program for MDOC residents who are almost done with their prison sentence. It is also called “home confinement” or “supervised release.”

- If eligible, you can apply **to spend the last 30 months of your sentence in the community,** while under supervision.
- The program helps you get used to being back in the community with the support of a structured plan.

Probation officers supervise you during SCCP.

- You have to meet with your PO **within 24 hours** of being released on SCCP.
- Then, you have to meet with your PO **once a week for the first month.**
- After that, your PO will decide how often you have to meet.

For the official policy document, ask the librarian at the law library for Policy Number 27.2.

## What if I’m not interested in SCCP?

Here are other options to help you transition into the community:

- **Work Release:** Through this program, you can find a job outside the facility and make money. To qualify, you need to meet some of the same requirements as SCCP. Your case manager can help you know if you qualify for work release and can help you find a job.

- **Furlough Passes:** You can also ask to leave the facility for a short time with a furlough pass. This is like a special permission to visit your family or do other important things. There are rules that limit how many times you can leave.
