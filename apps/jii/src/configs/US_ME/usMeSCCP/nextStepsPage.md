# SCCP Application and Tips

## What makes a good SCCP application and essay?

You should work to ensure that your SCCP application is fully complete and no important information is missing. If possible, work closely with your case manager on your application to ensure that the information is complete.

In your SCCP application essay, consider the following:

- **Keep it simple** Write about the path you are on and your vision for the future, including the first steps you will take when released on to SCCP.

- **Keep it positive:** Focus on how you plan to do well while on SCCP. For example, you can write about how living with family will be a supportive and stable environment where you will be able to save up to eventually get your own place.

## How can I advocate well for myself?

**Being proactive** through the SCCP application process is the best way to advocate for yourself.

- When talking to your case manager, go prepared with a list of questions.
- Take the time to ask your case manager all of the questions you have. Ask them for a follow-up appointment if they don’t have all the answers for you at that moment.
- When checking on the progress of your application, be patient and respectful. Case managers are handling a lot of different issues and paperwork, so a simple “excuse me” or “thank you for your time” can go a long way.

## What happens after I submit my application?

Once you fill out the packet and return it to your case manager, there are a few steps that happen for you to be approved and released:

1. The application will be brought by your case manager to the facility unit team for review.
1. If the unit team agrees to move your application forward, it will then be sent to probation for review.
1. Once the application returns from probation with an approval, it goes to the Central Office for final approval.
1. Then the CPC and case manager will begin the process of releasing you on to SCCP.
