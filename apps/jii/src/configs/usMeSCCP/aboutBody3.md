If you meet the requirements for SCCP, you’ll need to fill out an SCCP application. In the application, you’ll have to list out your plan for release into the community, including the following:

- home plan
- employment or education plan
- treatment programs (if applicable)
- support systems you have in the community

You’ll also have to write an essay describing the path you’re on, the first steps you’ll take when released, and how you plan to do well on SCCP.
