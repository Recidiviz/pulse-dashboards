SCCP is a program for MDOC residents who are almost done with their prison sentence. It is also called “home confinement” or “supervised release.” **If you meet certain rules, you can apply to spend the last 30 months of your sentence in the community, even though you’re still under MDOC custody.** The program helps you get used to being back in the community with the support of a structured plan.

**Probation officers supervise you during SCCP.** You have to meet with your PO within 24 hours of being released on SCCP. Then, you have to meet with your PO in-person every week for the first month. After that, your PO will decide how often you have to meet.

For the official policy document, go to the law library and ask the librarian for Policy Number 27.2.

## What is the application and approval process for SCCP?

If you meet the requirements, your case manager can give you an <FormPreview linkText="SCCP application packet" /> to fill out. There are several steps to the application:

- Fill out application form with information about your release plan including housing, employment / education, treatment (if applicable), and your support system
- Write an essay describing the path you’re on and how you plan to be successful while on SCCP
- Sign paperwork agreeing to the conditions of the program
- Get a warrantless search agreement form signed by the the person’s whose place you’ll be living in

Once you fill out the packet and return it to your case manager, there are a few steps that happen for you to be approved and released:

1. The application will be brought to the facility unit team for review.
1. If the unit team agrees to move your application forward, it will then be sent to probation for review.
1. Once the application returns from probation with an approval, then the CPC and case manager will begin the process of releasing you on to SCCP.

## What if I’m not interested in SCCP?

If you’re not interested in SCCP, there are other options to help you transition into the community:

- **Work Release:** Through this program, you can find a job outside the facility and make money. To do this, you need to meet some of the same requirements as SCCP. Your case manager can help you know if you qualify for work release and can help you find a job.
- **Furlough Passes:** You can also ask to leave the facility for a short time with a furlough pass. This is like a special permission to visit your family or do other important things. There are rules that limit how many times you can leave.

## What makes a good SCCP application and essay?

You should work to ensure that your SCCP application is fully complete and no important information is missing. If possible, work closely with your case manager on your application to ensure that the information is complete.

<p><FormPreview linkText="Preview a blank SCCP application" icon /></p>

In your SCCP application essay, consider the following:

- Keep it simple - Write about the path you are on and your vision for the future, including the first steps you will take when released on to SCCP.

- Keep it positive - Focus on how you plan to do well while on SCCP. For example, you can write about how living with family will be a supportive and stable environment where you will be able to save up to eventually get your own place.

## How can I advocate well for myself?

Being proactive through the SCCP application process is the best way to advocate for yourself. Examples of proactivity include:

- When talking to your case manager, go prepared with a list of questions.
- Take the time to ask your case manager all of the questions you have. Ask them for a follow-up appointment if they don’t have all the answers for you at that moment.
- When checking on the progress of your application, be patient and respectful. Case managers are handling a lot of different issues and paperwork, so a simple “excuse me” or “thank you for your time” can go a long way.
