# Learn if you are eligible for opportunities like community confinement

As of now, this website shows information about the **Supervised Community Confinement Program (SCCP).** SCCP – sometimes called “home confinement” – allows you to spend the last 30 months of your sentence in the community, while still under MDOC custody.

This website answers questions like...

- How does the Supervised Community Confinement Program work?
- What do I need to do in order to become eligible for SCCP? Could I be eligible now?
- How can I apply for SCCP?

Over time, information about other opportunities, like work release, may be added.
