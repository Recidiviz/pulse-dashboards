The Release to Supervision date (RTS Date) is the date which has been determined by deductions from the maximum term of a prisoner’s sentence for good conduct deductions under section 129C, subsection (a) of section 129D and a further deduction for any program completion credits earned under subsection (c) of section 129D; provided however, that such date shall not be earlier than the date which has been determined by reducing a prisoner’s imposed maximum term of sentence by 35%.

The RTS Date is a release to parole supervision without the need for a parole hearing, based upon completion credits earned through programming and education pursuant to M.G.L.c.127, §129D. The RTS date is created pursuant to M.G.L.c.127, §130B upon the award of 30 days of completion credits. The RTS date is based on the Maximum Date minus EGT, Camp Time, Boost Time and Completion Credits. The RTS date cannot be reduced by more than 35% by the total number of deductions from sentence. Note that only one-half of this 35% or 17.5% may be completion credits.
