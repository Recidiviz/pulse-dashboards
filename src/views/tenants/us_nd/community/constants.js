      admissions: revocations resulting in incarceration at a DOCR facility. Revocations resulting
      in continuation of supervision, a county jail sentence, or termination of supervision are not
      considered. In addition, revocations are counted only when an individualâ€™s admittance to a
      facility is documented in Elite as a revocation. Individuals who have their supervision
      terminated due to revocation (resulting in incarceration) but are admitted back into the
      system with the code "new admission" are not included in revocation counts.

      are included whether or not they result in incarceration.`,
