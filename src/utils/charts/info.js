but who have not been legally revoked. This chart (like all charts on the page) will
automatically repopulate to match whatever filter(s) the user has selected. For example,

selected by the user, according to their most serious violation and the total number of
violation reports and notices of citation. The user can select the time period for revocations
included in the chart by using the drop-down menu in the upper left corner of the page.
The most serious violation and total number of reported violations are determined by looking back
at all violation reports and notices of citation filed within one year prior to the last reported
violation before their revocation. For example, if the last violation a person committed occurred
on February 1, 2017, and they were revoked on January 15, 2018, the most serious violation and
number of violations would be determined by looking over the period of February 1, 2016 -
February 1, 2017. This methodology negates the lag time between the last violation report and the
court's decision to revoke, and therefore gives a fuller picture of a person's behavioral record
leading up to the decision to recommend revocation. Reports filed after the revocation are not
included, since they were presumptively irrelevant to the revocation. These violation counts
account for all types of violation reports, including supplementals. Hence, if a person had three
initial violation reports and one supplemental report, they would be counted as having four
violations. They would be categorized according to the most severe violation reported in all of
these reports, regardless of whether it was in the initial report or supplemental report.`,

technical, substance use, municipal offense, absconsion, misdemeanor, felony. The most serious
violation determines what row a person is placed in, regardless of whether it was the most recent
violation. For example, if a person had one misdemeanor violation, then two technical violations,
then one substance use violation, and then they were revoked, they would be placed in the
misdemeanor row because a misdemeanor is their most serious violation.`,

would show: For each risk level, the number of people revoked whose most serious
violation was a technical, divided by the total number of people whose most serious
violation was a technical, including those who were not revoked. Comparing these percentages will
indicate whether revocation practices are sensitive to risk level. That is, whether people who are
higher risk are likelier to be revoked than lower risk people who have similar violation
histories. For people who have not been revoked, the most serious violation is identified by
considering all violations reported within one year from either the current date (if the person

technical violations. The yellow bars represent different categories of law violations. This is
calculated as follows: The total number of violation reports or notices of citation upon which each
type of violation appears, divided by the total number of violation reports or notices of citation
filed. Violation counts include all reported violations filed within one year of a person's last
violation before they were revoked. For this chart only, if multiple violation types are listed on
one violation report or notice of citation, they are all counted. For example, if a single notice of
citation lists both an employment violation and a reporting violation, both are counted. Hence the
total number of reported violations included in this chart will be larger than the total number of
violation reports and notices of citation. For example, if there were a total of 100 violation
reports and notices of citation, but each report listed 2 different violations, the denominator in
each percentage would still be 100. If, out of these 100 violation reports and notices of citation,
20 included at least one employment violation, then the percentage for employment violations would
