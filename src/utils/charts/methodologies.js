          the selected filters.

          Revocations are considered probation revocations or parole revocations
          based on the DOCR admission reason. Because only one reason can be
          selected, an individual&apos;s revocation will count only towards
          EITHER parole or probation even if they were on both parole and
          probation prior to incarceration.

          While on supervision, individuals are attributed to the office of

          revocation or a probation revocation based on the admission reason.

          the specified year.
        </li>
        <li>
          The follow up period starts from the date an individual is released
          from a DOCR facility. If they are released twice within the release
          cohort year, the follow up period starts from the first release: the
          second period of incarceration adds to the reincarceration count for
          the cohort.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stay length refers to time actually spent incarcerated prior to their
          most recent release from a DOCR facility. This is bucketed into
          12-month windows for sampling.

          County of residence is determined by an individual&apos;s most recent
          home address. If the most recent address is that of a ND DOCR facility
          or parole and probation office, the last known non-incarcerated
          address is used.

        <li>
          Just over 40% of people with known reincarcerations are not included
          in the map view or in selections by county of residence. For
          approximately 28% of people, this is because there is no known
          non-incarcerated address. For approximately 13% of people, this is
          because the last known non-incarcerated address is outside of North
          Dakota.

          Individuals who have been referred multiple times are counted for each

          denied, have their situation change, be referred again, be accepted,
          and currently be enrolled in Free Through Recovery. This would count
          as one denied status in the month of the first referral and one in
