          The case-level population projection model is designed to simulate the
          state criminal justice system in order to forecast incarcerated and
          supervised populations. The model is an agent-based stock and flow
          simulation that uses patterns in the historical data and sentencing
          information to calculate how people flow through the criminal justice
          system. The case-level data enables increased granularity for the
          underlying populations which makes the model adaptive and accurate. It
          also allows enforcement of individualsâ€™ sentence lengths, such that
          the behaviors of all people already in the justice system at the run
          date of the model are projected true to reality. Furthermore, the
          model enables historical, current, and future state analyses of where
          population changes are stemming from and the cycles for distinct
          population groups. The model stays up to date and can be run as
          frequently as data is received from the DOC.
