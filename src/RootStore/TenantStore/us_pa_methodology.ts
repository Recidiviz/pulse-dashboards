For those recommitted under Act 122, individuals for whom their commitment length is unknown will be placed in the "SCI < 6 MONTHS" category. The SCI commitment length may be unknown when an individual has a recorded recommitment to a CCC or Contract Facility with the "Program 46" code, but there is missing data for the corresponding board action specifying the length of stay mandated by the parole board. Counts do not include (1) people with Parole Violator Pending status - recommitments for these individuals are counted on the date their status changes to Convicted Parole Violator or Technical Parole Violator; (2) people who are serving a State Indeterminate Punishment sentence; (3) people recommitted for treatment in a CCC or Contract Facility. Person-based counts are used throughout the dashboard, so if a single individual has multiple recommitments in the selected time period, the dashboard counts their most recent recommitment. This chart (like all charts on the page) will automatically repopulate to match whatever filter(s) the user has selected.

      body: `This chart plots people who were recommitted on a board action to an SCI, CCC, or Contract Facility from parole during the time period selected by the user, according to their most serious violation and the total number of violation reports. The user can select the time period for recommitments included in the chart by using the drop-down menu in the upper left corner of the page. The most serious violation and total number of reported violations are determined by looking back at all violation reports filed within one year prior to the last reported violation before their recommitment. For example, if the last violation a person committed occurred on February 1, 2017, and they were recommitted on January 15, 2018, the most serious violation and number of violations would be determined by looking over the period of February 1, 2016â€“February 1, 2017. This methodology negates the lag time between the last violation report and the board action, and therefore gives a fuller picture of a person's behavioral record leading up to the recommitment decision. Reports filed after the recommitment are not included, since they were presumptively irrelevant to the recommitment.`,

The blue bars represent the different categories of conditions violated that constitute technical violations. The orange bars represent law violations. This is calculated as follows: the total number of violation reports upon which each type of violation appears, divided by the total number of violation reports filed. Violation counts include all reported violations filed within one year of a person's last violation before they were recommitted. For this chart only, if multiple violation types are listed on one violation report, they are all counted. For example, if a single violation report lists both an absconsion violation and an electronic monitoring violation, both are counted. Hence the total number of reported violations included in this chart will be larger than the total number of violation reports. For example, if there were a total of 100 violation reports, but each report listed 2 different violations, the denominator in each percentage would still be 100.
