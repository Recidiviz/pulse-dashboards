The user can select the time period for admissions included in the chart by using the drop-down menu in the upper left corner of the page. The most serious violation and total number of reported violations are determined by looking back at all violation reports filed within one year prior to the last reported violation before their admission. For example, if the last violation a person committed occurred on February 1, 2017, and they were admitted on January 15, 2018, the most serious violation and number of violations would be determined by looking over the period of February 1, 2016–February 1, 2017. This methodology negates the lag time between the last violation report and the board action, and therefore gives a fuller picture of a person’s behavioral record leading up to the admission decision. Reports filed after the admission are not included, since they were presumptively irrelevant to the admission.`,

For example, if a person had one law violation, then two low technical violations, then one substance use violation, and then they were admitted, they would be placed in the law violation row because a law violation is their most serious violation.`,

For example, if the user selected the low technical row on the plot, the chart would show for each district, the number of people admitted whose most serious violation was a low technical, divided by the total number of people on supervision whose most serious violation was a low technical, regardless of whether they were admitted. Continuing with this example, if a user hovers over the district column, the numerator would be all people admitted for a low technical violation in that district, and the denominator would be all people who committed a low technical violation, whether they were admitted to a DOC facility or not. Comparing these percentages will indicate whether admission practices differ by district for various violation histories. That is, whether people with similar violation histories are admitted more frequently in one district than another. For people who have not been admitted, the most serious violation is identified by considering all violations reported within one year from either the current date (if the person is still on supervision) or the date that the person was discharged from supervision.`,

      body: `This chart shows the relative frequency of each type of violation among the selected group. The blue bars represent the different categories of conditions violated that constitute technical violations. The orange bars represent law violations. This is calculated as follows: the total number of violation reports upon which each type of violation appears, divided by the total number of violation reports filed. Violation counts include all reported violations filed within one year of a person's last violation before they were admitted. For this chart only, if multiple violation types are listed on one violation report, they are all counted. For example, if a single violation report lists both an absconsion violation and an electronic monitoring violation, both are counted. Hence the total number of reported violations included in this chart will be larger than the total number of violation reports. For example, if there were a total of 100 violation reports, but each report listed 2 different violations, the denominator in each percentage would still be 100. If, out of these 100 violation reports, 20 included at least one employment violation, then the percentage for employment violations would be 20/100=20 percent.`,
