/**
 * Utilities for retrieving and caching metrics for the app.
 *
 * In the current implementation, metrics are generated by the Recidiviz data platform and stored
 * in two separate formats as metric files in Google Cloud Storage: an optimized format as compressed
 * txt files that represent compact versions of sparse matrices, and a more readable format via
 * JSON Lines. Those files are pulled down and cached in memory with a TTL. That TTL is unaffected by
 * access to the cache, so files are re-fetched at a predictable cadence, allowing for updates to
 * those files to be quickly reflected in the app without frequent requests to GCS.
