        *Note*: In many states (e.g. TN), supervision users are only able to search for other users in the same district as them. If a user cannot search for anyone, thereâ€™s a good chance their district is set incorrectly. If a user cannot search for a specific staff member, their districts probably do not match. Before filing a ticket, check the [Admin Panel Roster page](https://admin-panel-prod.recidiviz.org/admin/line_staff_tools/state_role_default_permissions) to make sure all districts are set appropriately.
