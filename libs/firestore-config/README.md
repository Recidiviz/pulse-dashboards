# firestore-config

This library contains Firestore security rules and scripts for testing and deploying them. It has no direct dependents but both the `staff` and `jii` apps use the Firestore databases that are configured by this library.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test firestore-config` to execute the unit tests via [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/).
