# datatypes

"Datatypes" are types of data that may be consumed by our applications and other libraries. Often they are objects fetched from a backend, such as Firestore or a REST API server; in unit tests or Offline Mode, they will instead be read from local fixture files.

This library exports type definitions, runtime parsing schemas, and fixture files for those datatypes. It also includes some utilities for creating internally-consistent fixtures.
