## Development

### Getting set up
1. Grab the source:

   ```git clone git@github.com:Recidiviz/pulse-dashboards.git```
1. Install Yarn package manager:

   ```brew install yarn```

   For alternative Yarn installation options, see [Yarn Installation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
1. Install dependencies:

   ```yarn install```

That's it! We suggest installing a linting package for your preferred code editor that hooks into [eslint](#eslint). We recommend [linter-eslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint) for Atom.

#### Environment variables
Second and last, set up your environment variables.

For the frontend: copy the `.env.frontend.example` file and set variables accordingly per environment. At the moment, the app is deployed to both staging and production environments. Staging relies on environment variables stored in `.env.development` and production relies on variables in `.env.production`. Local relies on `.env.development.local`.

Expected frontend environment variables include:
* `REACT_APP_API_URL` - the base URL of the backend API server.
* `REACT_APP_AUTH_ENV` - a string indicating the "auth environment" used to point to the correct Auth0 tenant. Either "development" or "production". Must match the backend `AUTH_ENV` variable.
* `REACT_APP_FEEDBACK_URL` - the URL of the Recidiviz Dashboard Feedback form. 
* `REACT_APP_IS_DEMO (OPTIONAL)` - whether or not to run the frontend in demo mode, which will run the app without requiring authentication. This should only be set when running locally and should be provided through the command line, along with the backend sibling below. To run the app in demo mode, use the following command: `./run_in_demo_mode.sh`

The build process, as described below, ensures that the proper values are compiled and included in the static bundle at build time, for the right environment.

For the backend: copy the `.env.backend.example` file into `.env` and set variables appropriate for your local environment. Set these same variables in your Google App Engine yaml files, if deploying to GAE. Those files are described later on.

Expected backend environment variables include:
* `AUTH_ENV` - a string indicating the "auth environment" used to point to the correct Auth0 tenant. Either "development" or "production". Must match the frontend `REACT_APP_AUTH_ENV` variable.
* `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` - a relative path pointing to the JSON file containing the credentials of the service account used to communicate with Google Cloud Storage, for metric retrieval.
* `METRIC_BUCKET` - the name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket where the metrics reside.
* `IS_DEMO` (OPTIONAL) - whether or not to run the backend in demo mode, which will retrieve static fixture data from the `server/core/demo_data` directory instead of pulling data from dynamic, live sources. This should only be set when running locally and should be provided through the command line, along with the frontend sibling above. To run the app in demo mode, use the following command: `./run_in_demo_mode.sh`

### Authentication
The backend API server and most frontend views in the app are authenticated via [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). You can control which views are authenticated by specifying `Route` versus `PrivateRoute` in `src/App.js`. If you are setting this app up completely fresh, you will need to create your own Auth0 account and set the relevant details in `src/auth_config_dev.json` and `src/auth_config_production.json`. See `src/auth_config.json.example`.

This setup assumes you have two separate Auth0 tenants, one for lower tiers and one for production. The former should be configured in `auth_config_dev.json` and the latter in `auth_config_production.json`. Which file is loaded and used relies on the `AUTH_ENV` environment variable on the backend and the `REACT_APP_AUTH_ENV` environment variable on the frontend. It is important that the same config file be loaded on the backend and frontend servers in a given tier so that API authentication will work.

### Linting & running tests
A yarn script is available to run both [eslint](#eslint) and tests via [Jest](#jest):

```yarn test```

Running tests this way will also write code coverage statistics to stdout and the `coverage` directory.

To run eslint manually:

```eslint src```

To run Jest manually:

```jest [optional-filepath]```

If you would like to get your TDD on and run Jest in watch mode, you can use:

```yarn test:watch```

### Running the application locally
A yarn script is available for starting the development servers. The React frontend is served out of port `3000` and the Node/Express backend is served out of port 3001. This will also automatically open a browser to localhost on the appropriate port, pointing to the frontend.

```yarn dev```

The development servers will remain active until you either close your terminal or shut down the entire setup at once using `control+c`.

**Note:** The development servers do not need to be restarted when source code is modified. The assets will automatically be recompiled and the browser will be refreshed (when there's a frontend change). Thanks, Webpack!

### Demo mode

When running locally, you can run the app in demo mode to point the app to static data contained in `server/core/demo_data`. This is useful for debugging issues that materialize under specific data circumstances, for demonstrating the tool without exposing real data, for development when you don't have Internet access, and other use cases.

You can launch in demo mode locally via: `./run_in_demo_mode.sh`

Running via that command is important because environment variables are required for both the frontend and backend servers. Running with only one or the other in demo mode produces a fairly broken experience.

## Deploys

As noted above, the Dashboard is two components: a React frontend and a Node/Express backend providing a thin API. The app can be run locally, in staging, and in production. Deploying to staging and production are very similar, as described below.

### Deploying to staging

#### Frontend
To generate a staging build of the frontend, invoke the following yarn script: `yarn build-staging`.

Each time this is run, the `build` directory will be wiped clean. A [bundle analysis](#Bundle-analysis) report, found in `build/report.html`, will also be generated on each invocation of this script. This will include the appropriate environment variables from `.env.development`.

You should then test this locally by running `firebase serve`: it will run the staging build locally, pointed to the staging API backend--if you also have backend changes, deploy the backend as described in the next subsection. When you're satisfied, deploy the frontend to staging with `firebase deploy -P staging`. Test vigorously on staging before deploying to production.

#### Backend
We deploy the backend to Google App Engine with configured yaml files. Copy the `gae.yaml.example` file into files named `gae-staging.yaml` and `gae-production.yaml`, and set environment variables accordingly.

Deploy the backend to staging Google App Engine with `gcloud app deploy gae-staging.yaml --project [project_id]`. This will upload any updated backend code/configuration to GAE and start the server (GAE runs `npm start` only once the deploy succeeds and is stable). Test vigorously on staging before continuing to production.

### Deploying to production
Follow the instructions described above, but with different commands for both frontend and backend deploys.

Generate a production build of the frontend with `yarn build`. Test locally with `firebase serve`. Deploy the frontend with `firebase deploy -P production`.

Deploy the backend to production GAE with `gcloud app deploy gae-production.yaml --project [project_id]`.

Test vigorously! Don't be afraid to rollback the deploy of frontend or backend through the Firebase and GAE consoles.

## Tooling

### Yarn
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) is a package manager for Node modules that is similar to npm but with [superior performance](https://github.com/pnpm/node-package-manager-benchmark). It is used to specify and install dependencies for the application. Adding a dependency is as simple as:

```yarn add package```

If the package is not required in production it should be added as a development dependency with the `--dev` flag:

```yarn add --dev package```

See the [Yarn documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs) for more details and a full list of commands available via the CLI.

### Webpack
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is a highly-configurable tool for compiling JavaScript modules. We use it to bundle all of our JavaScript, CSS, and static assets for efficient distribution in production.

Webpack has a reputation for being intimidating but don't let that deter you. The core idea of webpack is to specify a set of inputs (file types and locations), indicate how those inputs should be processed (via loaders and plugins), and specify how the resulting output should be generated. Check out the Webpack [Getting Started guide](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/) if you're interested in learning more.

#### Bundle analysis
We have configured `BundleAnalyzerPlugin` to facilitate bundle analysis. This can be useful for managing bundle bloat or spotting unnecessary dependencies. For convenience, a yarn script has been created to launch the bundle analyzer tool. To run this, execute the following command:

```yarn analyze-bundle```

**Note**: you will need to have either started the development server or executed a production build at least one time for this to work as the `build/report.html` file is generated during either of these actions.

### Jest
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) is our testing framework. It provides a friendly testing API, a powerful and easy-to-use mocking functionality, and plenty of speed. Snapshot testing is also a nice feature but should be used with caution. It is served best as a supplement, rather than a substitute, of a robust set of unit tests that properly describes what a piece of code is intended to do.

To execute tests, see [Linting & running tests](#linting--running-tests).

To add new tests, create a file with the same name as the file you are testing and append the extension `.test.js`. This file should be located in the same directory as the file you are testing.

For example, if you are testing the `Recidiviz` component which is defined in `Recidiviz.js`, you would add tests in `Recidiviz.test.js`.

See Jest [API](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/api.html) and [Docs](https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/getting-started.html) for more information.

### Enzyme

[Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) is a utility for unit testing React components. It's particularly handy for its ability to shallow render a component for isolated testing, fully mount a component to test lifecycle methods, select elements in a variety of ways with ease, and simulate events to test handlers.

See Enzyme [API](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/) for more information.

### eslint
[eslint](https://eslint.org/) is a flexible linter for JavaScript. We have configured eslint to adhere to the Airbnb style guides for [Javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and [React](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/react), with a few [exceptions](https://github.com/Recidiviz/pulse-dashboards/.eslintrc), in addition to the base eslint JS rules.

To run the linter, see [Linting & running tests](#linting--running-tests).

We suggest installing a linting package for your preferred code editor that hooks into eslint. This will allow you to get real time feedback on code while you're writing it. We recommend [linter-eslint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint) for Atom.

### React
[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Unlike some other popular JS frameworks, it focuses exclusively on the view layer and is agnostic as to your choices for other parts of your application.

React [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) is very high quality and helpful for getting started.

## Application Structure
A quick overview of the directory structure and suggestions on where to put different things.

```
/build/
/public/
/src/
  assets/
  components/
  utils/
  views/
  App.js
  index.js
/server/
server.js
```
### Application root (/)
Home to files such as `server.js`, for running the backend server, and `package.json` for configuring build, dependencies, etc. Files in the application root are generally not bundled by Webpack.

### build
The bundled, static frontend. This is what gets exposed on the public frontend server.

### public
These are the raw public assets that form the _website itself_, i.e. `index.html` and the Favicon. When a build is generated, the contents of `src` are combined with the contents of `public` to generate `build`.

### src
Application frontend source code. If you're writing it, it should most likely end up here or in `/server` below.

#### src/assets
This is where frontend assets should live. JS logic, e.g. for creating exported images and json files of a given visualization, should live in `src/assets/scripts`. Static assets and style sheets should live in `src/assets/static` and `src/assets/styles`, respectively.

#### src/components
All React components should exist under this directory. Charts in particular live under `/components/charts/{subject}`.

Test files and CSS files should also be placed in the component directory.

#### src/utils
Application configuration files, shared constants, etc.

#### src/views
This is where individual page layouts are constructed. The main app is configured via `src/App.js` which uses the React Router to route to appropriate views depending on the requested path, e.g. routing the `/revocations` path to `src/views/Revocations.js`.

#### src/App.js and src/index.js
`App.js` is where the primary application view is defined, i.e. the central page layout and the frontend routing. `index.js` is the actual entry point to the frontend, i.e. where the `ReactDOM` is rendered.

### server
Application backend source code. If you're writing it, it should most likely end up here or in `/src` above.

### server.js
The actual entry point to the backend, i.e. where the Node/Express server, middleware, and routing are defined.
